<!--
Intro: HTML tags provide structure to a webpage and allow the addition of elements like photos and buttons.
This course covers the most common HTML tags through the creation of a cat photo app.
-->
<!--
Step 68: Add the declaration <!DOCTYPE html> as the first line of the code to indicate that 
the document is an HTML5 document. This ensures the browser adheres to industry-wide specifications.
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<!--
Step 67: Add the lang attribute with the value "en" to the opening <html> tag to specify that 
the language of the page is English. The <html> element is the root element that wraps 
all content on the page.
-->
<html lang="en">
    <!--
    Step 65: Add a <head> element above the <body> element to contain metadata about the document, 
    such as the title, links to stylesheets, and scripts. Metadata provides information 
    about the page that isn't directly displayed.
    -->
    <head>
        <!--
        Step 69: Inside the <head> element, add a <meta> element with the attribute charset set to "utf-8". 
        This tells the browser how to encode characters for the page. The <meta> element is a void element.
        With that last change, you have completed the Cat Photo App project. Congratulations!
        -->
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <!--
        Step 66: Add a <title> element within the <head> element with the text: "CatPhotoApp". 
        This title is what browsers display in the title bar or tab for the page.
        -->
        <title>CatPhotoApp</title>
    </head>
    <body>
         <!-- 
        Step 5: HTML5 introduces elements that identify different content areas, improving readability, SEO, and accessibility.
        The main element represents the main content of the document and should contain unique content.
        Example:
        <main>
        <h1>Main content of the document</h1>
        <p>Additional important content...</p>
        </main>
        Wrap the h1 and p elements with <main> tags to define the main section.
        -->
        <!-- 
        Step 6: Nested elements should be indented two spaces for readability.
        Example:
        <main>
        <h1>Main content</h1>
        <p>Additional content</p>
        </main>
        Ensure proper indentation inside the main element.
        -->
        <main>
            <!-- 
            Step 1: HTML elements have an opening and closing tag with content in between.
            Example: <openingTag>content</closingTag>
            The h1 element is a heading element used for the main heading of a webpage.
            Example: <h1>This is a main heading</h1>
            Change the text of the h1 element below from "Hello World" to "CatPhotoApp"
            -->
            <h1> CatPhotoApp</h1>
            <!-- 
            Step 16: Use the section element to separate different content areas. 
            The section element defines sections in a document and helps with SEO and accessibility. 
            Example: 
            <section>
            <h2>Section Title</h2>
            <p>Section content...</p>
            </section>
            Nest your h2, comment, p, and anchor (a) elements inside a section element.
            -->
            <section>
                <!-- 
                Step 2: The h1 to h6 elements indicate content importance. The lower the number, the higher the importance. 
                Example:
                <h1>most important</h1>
                <h2>second most important</h2>
                <h3>third most important</h3>
                Use only one h1 element per page. Add an h2 element below the h1 element with the text "Cat Photos"
                -->
                <h2> Cat Photos</h2>
                <!-- 
                Step 3: Use the p element to create a paragraph.
                Add a p element below the h2 element with the text "See more cat photos in our gallery."
                -->
                <!-- 
                Step 4: Comments allow you to leave messages or make code inactive without affecting the webpage display.
                A comment starts with < !-- and ends with -- >
                Example: <! -- TODO: Remove h1 -- >
                Add a comment above the p element with the text "TODO: Add link to cat photos."
                -->
                <!-- 
                Step 12: Any text can be turned into a link by wrapping it in anchor (a) tags. 
                Example: <p>I think <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">freeCodeCamp</a> is great.</p>
                In your p element, turn the words "cat photos" into a link by adding 
                <a> tags and setting the href attribute to https://freecatphotoapp.com.
                -->
                <!-- 
                Step 14: To open links in a new tab, use the target attribute on the anchor (a) element. 
                The value target="_blank" opens the linked document in a new tab or window. 
                Example: <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a>
                Add a target attribute with the value _blank to the anchor element's opening tag to open the link in a new tab.
                -->
                <p> See more <a href="https://freecatphotoapp.com" target="_blank">cat photos</a> in our gallery.</p>
                <!-- 
                Step 10: Use the anchor (a) element to link to another page. 
                Example: <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org"></a>
                Add an anchor element after the paragraph that links to: 
                https://freecatphotoapp.com. The link will not be visible in the preview yet.
                -->
                <!-- 
                Step 11: Link text must be placed between the opening and closing tags of the anchor (a) element. 
                Example: <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">click here to go to freeCodeCamp.org</a>
                Add the text "link to cat pictures" to the anchor element to serve as the link's text.
                -->
                <!-- 
                Step 13: Since the text "cat photos" is now a link in the p element, 
                the second anchor element below it is unnecessary. 
                Delete the entire anchor element below the p element.
                <a href="https://freecatphotoapp.com">link to cat pictures</a>
                -->
                <!-- 
                Step 7: Use the img element to add images to your website. 
                The img element has an opening tag only (void element). 
                Add an img element below the p element; no image will appear yet.
                -->
                <!--
                Step 8: HTML attributes are special words in the opening tag that control an element's behavior. 
                The src attribute in an img element specifies the image's URL. 
                Example: <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/platform/universal/fcc_secondary.svg">
                Add a src attribute to the existing img element with the URL:
                https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg
                -->
                <!-- 
                Step 9: Every img element should include an alt attribute for accessibility. 
                The alt text is used by screen readers and displayed if the image fails to load. 
                Example: <img src="cat.jpg" alt="A cat">
                Add an alt attribute to the img element with the text: 
                "A cute orange cat lying on its back."
                -->
                <!-- 
                Step 15: Any content, including images, can be turned into a link by wrapping it in anchor (a) tags. 
                Example: 
                <a href="example-link">
                    <img src="image-link.jpg" alt="A photo of a cat.">
                </a>
                Surround the img element with anchor tags and use https://freecatphotoapp.com as the href attribute value.
                -->
                <a href="https://freecatphotoapp.com">
                    <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back.">
                </a>
            </section>
            <!-- 
            Step 17: Add a new section element below the existing section element to create a second section. 
            -->
            <section>
                <!-- 
                Step 18: Inside the second section element, add a new h2 element with the text "Cat Lists."
                -->
                <h2> Cat Lists</h2>
                <!-- 
                Step 19: Adding a lower rank heading (h3) after the last h2 element indicates a new subsection. 
                Add an h3 element with the text "Things cats love:" inside the second section element.
                -->
                <h3> Things cats love:</h3>
                <!-- 
                Step 20: Use the ul element to create an unordered list of items. 
                Add a ul element after the h3 element with the text "Things cats love:". 
                At this point, nothing will be displayed until list items are added.
                -->
                <!-- 
                Step 21: Use the li element to create list items in an unordered list. 
                Example: 
                <ul>
                <li>milk</li>
                <li>cheese</li>
                </ul>
                Inside the ul element, add three list items to display the following: 
                - cat nip
                - laser pointers
                - lasagna
                -->     
                <ul>
                    <li> cat nip</li>
                    <li> laser pointers</li>
                    <li> lasagna</li>
                </ul>
                <!-- 
                Step 23 Passed: The figure element represents self-contained content and will allow you 
                to associate an image with a caption. Nest the image you just added within a figure element. 
                -->
                <figure>
                     <!-- 
                    Step 22 Passed: After the unordered list, add a new image with a src attribute value 
                    set to: https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/lasagna.jpg 
                    and its alt attribute value to: A slice of lasagna on a plate. 
                    -->
                    <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/lasagna.jpg" alt="A slice of lasagna on a plate.">
                    <!-- 
                    Step 23 Passed: A figure caption (figcaption) element is used to add a caption to describe 
                    the image contained within the figure element. After the image nested in the figure element, 
                    add a figcaption element with text set to: Cats love lasagna. 
                    -->
                    <!-- 
                    Step 25 Passed: To place emphasis on a specific word or phrase, you can use the em element.
                    Emphasize the word love in the figcaption element by wrapping it in an emphasis em element.
                    -->
                    <figcaption> Cats <em> love</em> lasagna.</figcaption>

                <h3> Top 3 things cats hate:</h3>
                <!-- 
                Step 27 Passed: The code for an ordered list (ol) is similar to an unordered list, 
                but list items in an ordered list are numbered when displayed. After the second section element's last h3 element, 
                add an ordered list with these three list items: flea treatment, thunder, other cats.
                -->
                <ol>

                        Since the radio buttons currently don't have a value attribute, add a value attribute to both. 
                        Set the value attribute to the same value as the button's id attribute for convenience. 
                        -->

                        Step 61 Passed: To make a checkbox checked or a radio button selected by default, add the checked attribute to the input element. 
                        Example: <input checked type="radio" name="meal" value="breakfast"> Breakfast
                        Add the word "checked" with a space between it and other attributes. 
                        Make the first radio button and the first checkbox selected by default.

                        <!--
                        Step 56 Passed: Associate text with an input by nesting the text inside a label and using a for attribute 
                        that matches the input's id. 
                        Example:

                        <label for="breakfast">Breakfast</label>
                        To link "Loving" with a checkbox, nest "Loving" in a label and use the matching for attribute.

                        <!--
                        Step 57 Passed: Add the name attribute with the value "personality" to the checkbox input. This helps servers process the form 
                        when multiple checkboxes are present, even though it's not visible in the browser.
                        -->

                        Step 58 Passed: Add a second checkbox with id="lazy" and the same name attribute as the previous checkbox.
                        Then, add a label with the text "Lazy" and associate it with the new checkbox using the for attribute.
                        -->
                        <input id="lazy" type="checkbox" value="lazy" name="personality"> <label for="lazy">Lazy</label>

                    Step 37 Passed: The input element allows you several ways to collect data from a web form. 
                    Nest an input element in the form element. Note that input elements are void elements and do not need closing tags.

                    <!-- 
                    Step 38 Passed: Create a text field to get text input from a user by adding the type attribute with the value "text" to the input element.

                    <!-- 
                    Step 39 Passed: In order for a form's data to be accessed by the location specified in the action attribute, 
                    you must give the text field a name attribute and assign it a value to represent the data being submitted. 
                    Add the name attribute with the value "catphotourl" to your text field. Example Code <input type="text" name="name">

                    <!-- 
                    Step 40 Passed: Placeholder text is used to give people a hint about what kind of information to enter into an input. 
                    Add the placeholder text "cat photo URL" to your input element. Example Code <input type="text" placeholder="Ex. Jane Doe">.

                    <!-- 
                    Step 41 Passed: To prevent a user from submitting your form when required information is missing, 
                    add the required attribute to the input element. There's no need to set a value to the required attribute; 
                    just add the word "required" to the input element, ensuring there is space between it and other attributes. 
                    -->

                    Step 42 Passed: The button element is used to create a clickable button. 
                    Add a button element with the text "Submit" below the input element. 
                    The default behavior of clicking a form button without any attributes submits the form to the location specified in the form's action attribute.

                    <!-- 
                    Step 43 Passed: Even though you added your button below the text input, they appear next to each other on the page because both input and button elements are inline elements. 
                    Add the type attribute with the value "submit" to the button to clarify that it is a submit button.

        Step 62 Passed: The <footer> element defines a footer for a document or section, often containing 
        information like author details, copyright, terms of use, or contact links.
        Add a <footer> element after the <main> element.
